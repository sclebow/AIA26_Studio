# Team 04 Progress

## 2026-05-17 Rewrite Reset

The codebase was cleaned up and reset around one canonical LangGraph implementation.

### Completed

- [x] Archived both conflicting Python implementations into `legacy/`.
- [x] Created a new canonical agent package in `agent/`.
- [x] Replaced interactive in-graph human feedback with non-blocking `await_human` state.
- [x] Rebuilt the workflow as a planner plus hub-and-spoke execution graph.
- [x] Added grouped MCP tool policy enforcement by action.
- [x] Added typed `PlanStep` state, planner-owned task sequencing, and explicit `replan_required` conditions.
- [x] Narrowed the execution supervisor to the active plan step and its relevant tool family.
- [x] Added deterministic smoke tests in `tests/test_agent_graph.py`.
- [x] Rewrote `ARCHITECTURE.md` to match the active codebase.
- [x] Implemented the local Python `generate_building_boundary` tool that returns footprint polyline coordinates and metrics.
- [x] Integrated the local boundary tool into the runtime with a composite tool client instead of routing initial shape generation through MCP.
- [x] Added focused geometry tests for the local boundary tool and kept the full Team 04 test suite passing.
- [x] Added a notebook test harness at `test_generate_building_boundary.ipynb` to run the tool and prepare a Grasshopper handoff payload.

### In Progress

- [ ] Grasshopper-side `import_building_boundary_04` tool definition and implementation.
- [ ] Live Rhino/Swiftlet validation of the JSON handoff from the local Python tool into Grasshopper.

### Current Active Components

- [x] `agent/graph.py`: canonical LangGraph definition.
- [x] `agent/decision_engine.py`: planner, execution-supervisor, and reporting interfaces.
- [x] `agent/tool_catalog.py`: tool grouping and action-policy enforcement.
- [x] `agent/models.py`: typed routing and plan-step models.
- [x] `agent/state.py`: workflow state including plan, active step, and replanning flags.
- [x] `agent/mcp_client.py`: HTTP MCP adapter plus local/composite tool support.
- [x] `agent/config.py`: runtime settings and layout loading.
- [x] `agent/tools/generate_building_boundary.py`: local footprint generation tool.
- [x] `main.py`: top-level entry point.
- [x] `test_generate_building_boundary.ipynb`: notebook-based local tool test and Grasshopper payload prep.

### Explicitly Archived

- [x] `legacy/PY_legacy/`
- [x] `legacy/python_legacy/`

### Remaining Work

- [ ] Connect the new planner and supervisor prompts to production Swiftlet tool behavior.
- [ ] Add integration tests against a live Swiftlet MCP server.
- [ ] Decide whether to keep one execution supervisor or split it further into shape-generation and optimization reasoners once the live tool surface is stable.
- [ ] Reconcile or refresh the remaining handoff documents that still describe the pre-rewrite system.
- [ ] Add a production Grasshopper import tool for local Python-generated footprint coordinates.
